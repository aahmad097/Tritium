# Tritium

A tool to enumerate and spray valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication.

## Background

Although many Kerberos password spraying tools currently exist on the market, I found it difficult to find tools with the following built-in functionality: 

* The ability to prevent users from locking out the domain
* The ability to integrate username enumeration with the password spraying process (User enumeration is a seperate functionality from the spray)
* The ability to recursively spray passwords rather than running one spray at a time 
* The ability to resume password sprays and ignore previously compromised accounts 

Tritium solves all of the issues mentioned above and more. User enumeration will no longer waste a login attempt because it uses the output of the first spray to generate a file of valid users. Tritium also gives the user the ability to pass it a password file to recursively spray passwords. And Finally, Tritium has built in functionality to detect if a domain is being locked out due to password spraying by saving the state and quitting the password spray if 3 consecutive accounts are locked out. 

## Usage

```
 ./Tritium -h

        ___________      .__  __  .__               
        \__    ___/______|__|/  |_|__|__ __  _____  
          |    |  \_  __ \  \   __\  |  |  \/     \ 
          |    |   |  | \/  ||  | |  |  |  /  Y Y  \
          |____|   |__|  |__||__| |__|____/|__|_|__/ v 0.5
